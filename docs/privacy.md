# Privacy Policy (ChimeCheck)

Effective date: **[INSERT DATE]**

ChimeCheck is operated by **OneTap Studio** (“we,” “us,” “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use ChimeCheck (the “Service”).

If you do not agree with this policy, do not use the Service.

## 1) What ChimeCheck does (important notice)
ChimeCheck provides a daily check-in experience and sends notifications when a check-in is missed.

**ChimeCheck is not an emergency service, not medical monitoring, and does not provide clinical advice.** If you believe someone is in immediate danger, call emergency services.

## 2) Information we collect

### A. Information you provide
Depending on how you use ChimeCheck, we may collect:
- **Account information:** name (optional), email address, password (if applicable)
- **Caregiver information:** caregiver names (optional) and email addresses you add to receive alerts
- **Preferences/configuration:** check-in deadline time, alert preferences, notification settings
- **Support communications:** messages you send to support

### B. Information generated by use of the Service
We may collect:
- **Check-in activity:** timestamps and status (e.g., “checked in” / “missed”)
- **Audit/history:** invitation accepted/declined, caregiver acknowledgements, and related timestamps
- **Device/app metadata:** basic technical logs (e.g., error logs), approximate location from IP (coarse), and similar diagnostics

### C. Voice platform data (Alexa / voice assistants)
If you use ChimeCheck through a voice assistant (e.g., Alexa):
- The voice platform may process your voice requests.
- We typically receive **intent/request metadata** necessary to provide the service (for example, that you performed a check-in), but **we do not need or intend to store raw voice recordings**.

> If you choose to store voice recordings or transcripts in the future, you must update this Privacy Policy before enabling that feature.

## 3) How we use information
We use information to:
- Provide the Service (record check-ins, send alerts, manage caregivers)
- Authenticate users and prevent fraud/abuse
- Communicate transactional messages (verification, password reset, caregiver invites, alerts, receipts)
- Maintain, debug, and improve reliability and security
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms

## 4) How we share information
We may share information:
- **With caregivers you designate** (e.g., missed check-in alerts and relevant status)
- **With service providers** who process data for us (e.g., email delivery, hosting, analytics, error monitoring), under contractual confidentiality and security obligations
- **For legal and safety reasons** (e.g., responding to lawful requests, protecting rights/safety, preventing abuse)

We do **not** sell your personal information.

## 5) Email and notifications
We send **transactional emails** related to your account and the Service, such as:
- Account verification and password reset
- Caregiver invitations
- Check-in confirmations (if enabled)
- Missed check-in alerts to caregivers
- Billing receipts/plan confirmations (if applicable)

We use third-party email delivery providers (for example, Twilio SendGrid) to send these messages.

## 6) Data retention
We retain information as long as needed to:
- Provide the Service
- Meet legal, accounting, or security requirements
- Resolve disputes and enforce agreements

You may request deletion (see Section 9). Some data may be retained where required by law or for legitimate security purposes.

## 7) Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 8) Children’s privacy
ChimeCheck is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9) Your choices and rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or obtain a copy of your information.

To make a request, contact:
- **chimecheck@onetapstudio.app**

We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.

## 10) Third-party links and services
The Service may link to third-party sites or services (such as caregiver portals or voice platforms). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## 11) Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the Effective date and post the revised policy here.
